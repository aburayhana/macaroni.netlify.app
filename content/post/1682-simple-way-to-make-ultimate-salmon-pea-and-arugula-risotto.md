recipeingredient:
- "350 g salmon fillet"
- "5 cups vegetable or fish stock"
- "1 large shallot finely chopped"
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "2 cups arborio rice"
- "1 tbsp cream cheese"
- "1/2 cup baby arugula"
- "1/2 cup frozen sweet peas"
- " Zest of 1 lemon finely grated"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a splash of veg oil in a medium pan. Season the salmon with salt and fry it for 4 minutes per side. You want the salmon just slightly undercooked. It&#39;ll finish in the risotto. Remove the fish to cool."
- "Put the stock in a small pot and keep it at a bare simmer. In a medium pot, heat a few tbsp extra virgin olive oil over medium heat, then add the shallot and garlic. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant."
- "Add the rice to the pot of shallot and garlic. Stir for 2 minutes until all the grains are shiny and coated with oil."
- "Stirring continually, add the stock to the rice a ladle at a time. Allow the liquid to absorb before adding the next ladleful. Stop adding stock once the rice is cooked (about 20 minutes). The risotto should be smooth, creamy, and just slightly runny. Add the cream cheese and stir until blended. The risotto will thicken. If it gets too clodgy, add a splash of stock. Add salt and cracked white pepper to taste."
- "Break the salmon up into large chunks, removing any skin or pinbones. Add the salmon to the risotto, along with the arugula, peas, and lemon zest. Fold everything together carefully. You don&#39;t want to break up the salmon too much. Serve warm."
