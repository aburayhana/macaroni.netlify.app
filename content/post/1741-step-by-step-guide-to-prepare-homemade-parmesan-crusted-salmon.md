- "Disclaimer: don&#39;t completely trust my measurements.  I don&#39;t measure when I make this recipe I just add until it looks and tastes right.  I tried to be as close to what I think I use though. Also feel free to change up the spices, just go easy on adding salt because the Parmesan already has plenty of salt in it"
- "Tips: Use wild caught salmon, farm raised just doesn&#39;t have the same flavor.  I always grate my own Parmesan for this. The cheese holds to the salmon a lot better."
