recipeingredient:
- "1 kg Fresh Vongole clams"
- "1 dozen or so fresh mussels"
- "3 anchovies chopped finely"
- "500 grams fresh or dry spaghetti"
- "1 box cherry tomatoes"
- "1/2 cup dry white wine"
- "1 clove garlic"
- "1/4 onion"
- "3 tbsp olive oil"
- "3 pinch salt"
- "1 handfull of freshly chopped parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "With all fresh shellfish it is a good idea to leave them to soak in a bowl of cold salted water for at least two hours before you want to cook them. This allows them to spit out any sand or debree they may have snapped shut with when they were harvested. You can use different shellfish for this dish, just remember to drain and rinse them before use, discarding any broken shells and scrubbing off any seaweed &#39;beards&#39;."
- "Bring a pan of water to the boil and add two pinches of salt. Whilst the water is boiling, drizzle the olive oil into a frying pan (enough to cover the bottom). Crack the garlic with the side of a knife and add to the oil on a low heat to simmer and brown. Add the chopped anchovies and stir."
- "Chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters and finely dice the onion. Before adding to the pan make sure you REMOVE the garlic. Fry the tomatoes and onion on a medium-low heat and season to taste with a large pinch of salt. Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Depending on which type or width spaghetti you are using the time will vary, but bare in mind that the shellfish needs around 5-6 minutes to cook."
- "When you have around six minutes before the pasta is ready, add the drained shellfish to the frying pan and add the white wine. Turn the heat up so the pan is simmering/bubbling nicely. Within a few minutes you should start to see and hear the shellfish popping open. Keep stirring the shells around and if it starts to stick or dry out you can add either more white wine or a splash of water or oil."
- "Once the pasta is ready, drain it and add it to the pan. Continue to stir and cook untill the majority of shells have opened (there are almost always some that will not, discard these as they have not edible). Add the parsley and taste to see if it requires any more seasoning. Serve."
