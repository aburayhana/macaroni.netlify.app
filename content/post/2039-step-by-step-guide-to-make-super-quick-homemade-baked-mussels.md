- "1 clove garlic"
- "1 pinch dry oregano"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400F/200C. Prepare a baking dish with slightly scrunched foil in it (to help the mussels be able to sit level)."
- "Scrub the mussels, removing any dirt and hairy bit, clean and discard any that are broken."
- "Put the mussels in a pot with the water, cover and put on a medium-high heat for a couple minutes until they open up. Remove form the heat."

- "Spoon/press some of the breadcrumb mixture on top of each mussel, trying to cover the mussel itself as far as possible. If you like, put a little of the mussel cooking juice in the bottom of the shell to help keep the mussel moist."
- "Bake the mussels for approx 7-10 minutes until gently golden on top. Serve warm or room temp (don&#39;t re-heat them as they will likely go dry and/or tough)."
