recipeingredient:
- "16 peeled and deveined raw prawns I used 3140 count"
- "1 medium onion chopped"
- "2 links sweet dried Spanish chorizo sliced 14 in thick"
- "6 cloves garlic crushed and sliced"
- "1 heap tsp Spanish paprika"
- "1/2 cup dry sherry"
- "3 cups whole milk"
- "6 tbsp butter"
- "2/3 cup cornmeal"
- "1/2 cup finely grated parmesan cheese"
- "1 handful Italian parsley chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the prawns in a small pot and add enough extra virgin olive oil to cover them about 2/3 up. Turn the heat to low. Poach the prawns, moving them gently every so often so that each prawn gets a chance to soak in the warm oil. Poach until they just start to go pink (5 to 10 minutes). Remove the prawns to a plate and put them in the fridge. Don&#39;t throw away the oil."
- "Add a splash of the prawn oil to a medium pan on medium-high heat. Add the onions and fry 3 to 4 minutes until they&#39;re soft and lightly browned. Add the chorizo and keep cooking until the sausages release their oil and start to crisp, about another 5 minutes. Toss in the garlic and paprika and fry 1 minute more. Add the sherry and let the alcohol cook off, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and start on the polenta."
- "Add the milk, butter and a couple of pinches of salt to a medium pot and put it on medium heat. Add the cornmeal a little at a time, whisking continually. Cook for 5 minutes or until the polenta&#39;s thickened but still a little runny. Whisk in the cheese and add extra salt and pepper to taste. Pour the polenta into a platter."
- "Put the pan of chorizo back on medium-high heat. Once it&#39;s up to temperature, add the prawns and a good splash of the prawn oil. Cook for 2 minutes, just to warm the prawns through. Mix in the parsley, then pour the mixture over the polenta."
