- "Press the fish, seafood and chicken randomly into the surface of the rice without disturbing it more than necessary."
- "Add more strained stock ladle by ladle as needed – there should be more than is needed. After 8 minutes if the pan is just moist remove from the heat. Cover the pan in foil and set aside for 10 minutes before serving garnished with the parsley and lemon wedges."
