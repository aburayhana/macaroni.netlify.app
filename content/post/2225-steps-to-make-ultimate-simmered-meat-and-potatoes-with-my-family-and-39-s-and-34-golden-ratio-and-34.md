recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Thinsliced beef pork or chicken also OK"
- "2 large Potatoes"
- "1/2 to 23 of a large one Onion"
- "1 tbsp SugarA"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauceA"
- "1 tbsp SakeA"
- "400 ml Dashi stock Its OK to use instant dashi granules mixed with water at about the same strength youd use in miso soup"
- "1 tbsp SugarB"
- "1 tbsp MirinB"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauceB"
- "2/3 to 1 tablespoon Soy sauceC"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the beef into reasonable bite-size pieces. Cut the onion into wedges about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Chop the potato into 3-4 cm chunks."
- "Spread just a little vegetable oil (even better if you use suet) in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat, and brown the beef in it."
- "Once the beef has browned, add in the onions and potatoes and stir-fry them together."
- "Once the oil has coated all the ingredients a bit, add the A seasonings, and stir-fry / simmer. Stir continually so that the items don&#39;t stick or burn, continuing until the ingredients have blended well and started to absorb the colors of the seasonings."
- "Add the B ingredients and turn the heat up to high to bring it to a boil."
- "Once the pot boils, cover the ingredients with an otoshibuta / drop lid (this is a must) that sits right on top of the ingredients inside the pot, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Simmer like this for about 20 minutes."
- "Be careful not to let the pot boil too briskly. Set the heat so that the simmering liquid just gently bubbles through the holes in the otoshibuta."
- "After 20 minutes, turn the heat down to the lowest setting, and take out a larger of the potato chunks to check its softness. The flavor will still be weak at this point."
- "If the potato still seems too firm, put the otoshibuta back on, turn the heat back up, and simmer for 3 more minutes. If the potatoes seem tender after this, remove the otoshibuta and drizzle in the C seasonings."
- "Turn the heat up to high, and boil for about a minute, gently swirling the pot occasionally to keep the potatoes from falling apart."
- "You could just eat the nikujaga as it is at the end of Step 10, but I recommend putting a lid on the pan and letting the contents cool for a bit (this also allows the potatoes to absorb even more flavor), and then it&#39;s done."
- "When you&#39;re ready to serve the nikujaga, warm it up carefully so that the potatoes don&#39;t fall apart, and then serve into bowls."
- "Rather than keeping the potatoes completely smooth and intact, it deliciouos when the potatoes are dense and floury."
- "This is a simple recipe that makes for a really flavorful, very delicious nikujaga."
- "Try to make this when you have plenty of time and can let the nikujaga cool down and really absorb the flavors before eating."
- "If you want to add in shirataki noodles, do so between Steps 6 and 8."
- "There is also a recipe for &#34;Waterless Nikujaga&#34; made in a Staub cocotte ronde (a round thick-bottomed cat iron pot) at. Please have a look!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/150645-waterless-nikujaga-simmered-meat-and-potatoes-in-a-staub-cocotte"
