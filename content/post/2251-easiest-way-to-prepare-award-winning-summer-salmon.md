recipeinstructions:
- "I had my sous chef chop about 1 1/2 Tbsp of dill and stir it into some Greek yogurt. We added horseradish and black pepper to taste."
- "I picked the majority of the remaining dill and sliced the tomatoes into large chunks, removing the core."
- "The butter was heated gently until browned. The dill fronds went in the pan and sizzled briefly, followed by tomatoes. Heat was removed."
- "I hit the tomatoes with a little salt and a touch of good balsamic, then set the pan aside."
- "To sear the salmon, I brought my trusty cast iron griddle to nearly smoking before adding a pour of olive oil. The prepped and lightly-salted salmon fillets were placed skin-side down in the pan to sear the skin crisp, then gently released with a fish spatula, flipped to brown the opposite side, and set aside to rest."
- "To plate, I spooned a mound of tomatoes into a bowl and placed the salmon fillet on top. I poured a little juice from the tomato pan over the salmon and added some dollops of dill yogurt. I tried to make it look pretty, but, well... It tasted good."
