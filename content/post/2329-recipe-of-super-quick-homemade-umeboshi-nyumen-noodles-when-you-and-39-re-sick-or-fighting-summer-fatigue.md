recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the somen noodles so that they are on the firm side. Wash well under running water, and drain in a sieve."
- "Chop the chicken (breast or thigh meat) into 2 cm pieces, and sprinkle with sake.  Make sure to discard the yellow fat from the chicken, since it will affect the flavor of the soup."
- "Chop the umeboshi finely into a paste. Put the pit into the dashi stock and simmer. This will give a faint umeboshi flavor to the dashi. Julienne the shiso leaves."
- "When the dashi comes to a boil, dredge the chicken pieces with katakuriko and put into the pot."
