recipeingredient:
- "1 slice smoked salmon"
- "2 eggs"
- "1 lemon"
- "1/2 avocado"
- "a few cherry tomatoes"
- "1 salad onion"
- "1 squirt sriracha"
- "1 handful fresh coriander leaves"
- " Coarse salt and black pepper"
- "1 handful pumpkin seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put a pan on and heat the water. When it starts to boil, add the eggs and set the timer to 7 mins if you like your hard-boiled eggs yolks softer. I find that they are much nicer that way if you are going to eat them warm. Boil for 10 mins if you prefer them hard."
- "Wash the salad ingredients (you can do this while the water is heating up in the pan)"
- "Chop the tomatoes, onion and avocado in that order. Then squeeze half a lemon over the avocado"
- "Add the fresh coriander, sriracha (or chilli flakes), a pinch of salt and a couple of grinds of black pepper and mix well. Set aside."
- "Cut the smoked salmon into small strips and put in another bowl. Squeeze the juice of the other lemon half. My timer had just pinged (hence the eggs waiting to join in...)"
- "Peel the eggs and cut into pieces over the salmon which will &#34;cook&#34; slightly thanks to the heat of the eggs"
- "Add the eggs and salmon to the salad bowl. Mix well. Taste and adjust salt and pepper accordingly"
- "Put your salad into a new bowl. Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over the salad and start eating quickly while the eggs and salmon retain some warmth. Enjoy ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š!!!"
