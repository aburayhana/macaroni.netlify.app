- "...and then mix it up with the mentaiko mix with your hands. Transfer to a serving plate, and drizzle on a little sesame oil, too. It&#39;s soooo good."
- "You can salt and prep the turnips in advance, have the mentaiko mixture ready to go separately, and refrigerate them both in advance. Toss them together just before serving, okay? If you mix them together in advance they will become watery."
