- "(Ingredients) There are so many. It doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have enough! The point is in how they&#39;re prepared!"
- "(Meat Seasoning) Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and add the seasoning! This is important! Rub the ● seasoning into the meat very well."
- "(A dirty burdock root is not scary!) It&#39;s easy if you use aluminum foil to scrub the burdock like this."
- "(Burdock root) Wash the burdock root well and cut into pieces with diagonal cuts. Soak in water to remove the harsh taste! Change the water occasionally!"
- "(Carrot) Since this was a nice carrot, just chop it up!"
- "(Lotus root) Since lotus root changes color easily, soak it in vinegar water! 1 tablespoon of vinegar + 300ml of water is a nice balance!"
- "(Konnyaku) Boil to get rid of the bad taste!"
- "(Give the konnyaku some shine) Once it has boiled, drain in a colander."
- "(Boiled Bamboo shoots) Cut like this! The white mealy parts actually contain the nutrient tyrosine, so don&#39;t cut it off!"
- "(Taro root) I used frozen ones this time. Thaw at room temperature."

- "Once the chicken is browned as shown in the photo, flip over."
- "Dump everything, including the oil, into the pot! This is where the flavor will get packed in."
- "(Pack in the flavor.) Turn the heat to medium. First add the ingredients that take longer to cook (burdock root, carrot, lotus root, konnyaku, bamboo) and coat with the oil rendered from the chicken."
- "Pour in enough water to barely cover the ingredients and bring to a boil. Don&#39;t forget to remove the scum!"
- "Once the scum has been removed to a certain extent, cover with a drop-lid! It&#39;s okay to only remove the scum that you can see! If you do too much, you&#39;ll take away the flavor~"
- "Wait for 10 minutes with the heat on low, then add the taro! Add all of the ◇ ingredients! Cook on low heat for 5 minutes!"
- "Add the snow peas and gently stir for 2-3 minutes."
