- "3 lbs pork shoulder boneless"
- " Garlic powder cumin black pepper sea salt"
- "2 tbs cider vinegar"
- " For the sauce"
- "30 dried California Chiles"
- "1/4-1/2 Oz dried peeled shrimp to taste"

- "1 1/3 cups lard or shortening"
- " Other ingredients"
- "2 bags dried corn husks"
- "1 1/2 tbs flour"
- "1 1/2 tbs butter"
- " Shredded cheddar cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "To prepare the pork, lay chunks of shoulder meat in a crock pot. Preferably deboned. After 1 layer sprinkle seasonings over meat. Don&#39;t skimp. Layer more meat in and repeat. Drizzle vinegar over and close. Cook on low 8 hrs, then switch to warm."
- "For the sauce, destem and seed chiles. Place in a LG sauce pot. Just cover chiles with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes."
- "Spoon out a cup of the cooking liquid, place in a bowl with the dried shrimp. Let sit 15 minutes. Add spices and bouillon to chiles. Simmer another 10 minutes."
- "When chiles and shrimp are done, combine and let mixture cool. When able to handle, liquefy all ingredients in a blender. In batches, including all of the liquid. Let sit in the fridge overnight."
- "The next day, shred pork with a fork. Add a little bit more of the pork seasoning and 2 to 3 cups of the sauce. Fry in a large pan long enough for the pork to soak up the sauce. You don&#39;t want a lot of liquid in it though. This is the filling."
- "Next make the dough. Mix all dry ingredients. Cut in lard. Then mix the hot water in a bit at a time. Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in warm water 15 minutes or so."
- "When husks are pliable, find a small husk. Rip it into strips. This is what you will tie with."
- "Spread a thin layer of dough in the husk. About 3 x 5 inches."
- "Add 1 to 1/2 tbs filling on top of dough. Roll corn husk up like a burrito. Tie in the center with a double knot. Repeat many more times."
- "I used an auto steamer. You can use a LG pot if you have a rack to keep the tamales out of the water while steaming. Either way, layer tamales in your preferred cooking method. Steam for 45-55 minutes. This batch made about 4 dozen. I place in freezer bags and freeze. Good quick snack."
- "Meanwhile heat butter in a frying pan. Add flour and mix well. Don&#39;t cook until browned. Just before it turns. Slowly add the rest of the Chile puree. Cook until sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning to taste."
- "When tamales are done, remove husk and plate. Serve with sauce over the top and shredded cheddar cheese. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
