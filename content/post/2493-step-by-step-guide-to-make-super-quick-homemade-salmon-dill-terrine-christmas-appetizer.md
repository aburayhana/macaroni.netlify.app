- "1 tbsp Capers"
- "1 tbsp Chopped dill fennel or chives"
- "50 ml Milk"
- "6 grams Gelatin 3 tablespoons hot water"
- "1 tsp Lemon juice"
- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Grease the bottom of the mold and line with plastic wrap."
- "Cover the bottom of the mold completely with smoked salmon. It&#39;s okay to patch it!  I used 2 layers to make it thicker."
- "Lightly rinse the capers and chop. Dissolve the gelatin powder in boiling water."
- "Combine the cream cheese and milk, warm it up for just a very short time in the microwave, then stir in the gelatin mixture."

- "Take the terrine out of the fridge 30 minutes before you plan to serve it, as it tastes better at room temperature, rather than well chilled."
- "Goes well with crackers, sliced bread or a green salad."
