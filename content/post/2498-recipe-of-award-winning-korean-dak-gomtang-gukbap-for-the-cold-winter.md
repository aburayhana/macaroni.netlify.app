recipeingredient:
- "1 net 300 grams Chicken for hot pot"
- "1 leek Japanese leek the green part"
- "1 clove Garlic"
- "1 piece Ginger"
- "2 tbsp Sake"
- "1 1/2 liter Water"
- "50 grams Daikon radish"
- "50 grams Japanese leek"
- "1 tsp Dried scallop soup stock granules"
- "50 grams Carrot"
- "1 tbsp Salt"
- "1 dash Pepper"
- "1 tbsp White sesame seeds"
- "1 serving Cooked rice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the chicken with water and pat dry."
- "Create a slit with a knife along the bone. This is so that the juices can easily come out and the meat can easily separate."
- "Once the chicken is prepared, boil it in water."
- "After boiling, rinse the chicken well with water. Be sure to wash away the blood and guts."
- "Put 1~1.5 liters of water (depending on the size of your pot) in a pot, then add the chicken, green part of the leeks, garlic, ginger, and sake, and turn on the heat."
- "Crush the garlic and ginger. If you use a lid, you will have a cloudy soup. If you don&#39;t use a lid, you will have a transparent soup. This time, cover with the lid and leave alone for 1 hour."
- "I forgot to add the sake! When simmering, I leave it alone on the stove top. This is what it looks like in the middle of simmering."
- "If the water covers just a bit more than half of the ingredients, it&#39;s ready. If it&#39;s not cloudy, turn the heat up and let simmer for a bit longer. The water and oil will mix to make a milky color!"
- "If you let it sit overnight, it&#39;s even better and light and healthy! In this case, cover with plastic wrap on the surface of the liquid."
- "The reason for this is that the next day, when you peel the wrap off, it will remove the fat!"
- "Throw out the leeks and ginger. Take out the chicken and remove the bone. Return the chicken to the soup, add some water, and bring the soup back to a boil."
- "Slice the carrots and daikon into short, rectangular slices. Thinly slice the leek. You can use any vegetables you like, and cut them anyway you like, too!"
- "Simmer, simmer... Add the dried scallop soup stock granules. If you don&#39;t have any, you can use Chinese soup stock. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper."
- "Add 1/2~1 serving of rice to the soup. Add as much as you like. Let it simmer."
- "Transfer to a bowl, then sprinkle black pepper and white sesame seeds on top. Eat it with kimchi or green onion namul! It looks so delicious!"
