- "When the mix is done, pour it over the meat. Put the cover back on."
- "Add about half or 3/4 cup of water (or low sodium stock of your choice) into the skillet and add the fish sauce (oyster sauce works too) if you&#39;re not using anchovy paste) and tomato paste.

- "Please note: don&#39;t add carrots AND raisins. They both add sweetness, necessary for this dish to taste meaty. Don&#39;t add sugar. It&#39;s too one-dimensional in taste. But too much sweetness will make this dish taste like dessert!"
- "One more note: if you like, you can add tomatoes, either fresh or canned. 1 lb of fresh or 1-14.5 oz can of crushed canned tomatoes works. Use the liquid from the can to make the &#34;sauce&#34;."
