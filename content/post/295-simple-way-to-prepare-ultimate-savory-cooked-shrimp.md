recipeingredient:
- "5-10 Shrimp such as Black Tiger"
- "500 ml Water"
- "1 1/2 tsp Salt for parboiling"
- "50 ml Cooking sake"
- "1 pinch Salt to season"
- "3 shakes Flavor enhancer such as Ajinomoto"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the water to a boil, add the salt for parboiling, and add the shelled and de-veined shrimp."
- "Some seconds after the water comes back to a boil, when the outside of the shrimp changes color, take them out. This is just to remove the fishy taste, so it&#39;s okay if they are still raw inside."
- "Put 50 ml of cooking sake in a small pot and bring to a boil. Add the flavor enhancer and a pinch of salt."
- "Add the shrimp. Simmer for a bit less than a minute. Turn off the heat, cover the pan with a lid, and leave the shrimp to steam-cook with residual heat. If you are cooking a lot of shrimp, cover with a tight fitting lid and simmer over low heat while shaking the pan."
- "If you are using the shrimp for sushi rolls, skewer the shrimp so that they won&#39;t curl up, and follow steps 2 to 4. Leave the shrimp to cool in the simmering liquid, remove the skewers, and butterfly the shrimp from the belly side."
- "If you are using the shrimp as sushi toppings, butterfly the shrimp after step 5 from the belly side."
