recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 450°F."

- "Arrange the slices of cheese over the mushrooms.  Tear the slices to cover all of the mushrooms leaving no stuffing uncovered."
- "Bake the mushrooms for 12 to 15 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown."
- "When the mushrooms come out of the oven immediately sprinkle them with 1/2 teaspoon of minced parsley and serve."
