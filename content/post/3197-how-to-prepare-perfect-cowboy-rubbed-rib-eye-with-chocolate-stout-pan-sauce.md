recipeingredient:
- "1 large rib eye steak 115"
- "1 tbsp vegetable oil"
- " Rub"
- "1 tbsp ground coffee"
- "1 tbsp kosher salt"
- "1 tbsp coarse ground black pepper"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1 tsp ground cumin"
- "1 tsp hot red pepper flakes"
- "2 tsp dark brown sugar"
- " Sauce"
- "1 cup chocolate stout"
- "1/2 cup beef stock"
- "1 stick thyme"
- "1 tbsp unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the coffee, salt, paprika, peppers &amp; cumin together and toast lightly in pan until fragrant (alternatively you can toast whole spices then grind). Mix the spices with the sugar to make the rub"
- "Spread the rub all over the steak and let sit for awhile, if you do it the night before you&#39;ll have stronger flavor but if you do it right before serving it&#39;ll be good, too. (If you pre-rub and set it in the fridge, be sure to bring it up to room temperature before searing, so you do not shock the meat.)"
- "Heat a cast iron pan until it&#39;s really really hot -- a drop of water flicked into the pan should sizzle and bounce. Add vegetable oil, wait a few seconds until the oil heats up, then place the steak in the pan. It should sizzle; leave it there, do not touch it at all for 3-4 minutes. It should be browning on the bottom. Then place it under a hot broiler and broil to medium rare or desired doneness."
- "Remove the steak and let rest on a warm plate, cover with aluminum foil."
- "Add the thyme sprig to the pan and let it saute a bit till it gets nice and fragrant. Pour in the chocolate stout and deglaze the pan. Add the beef broth, whisk together and reduce by half over medium heat."
- "Remove the thyme sprig and whisk in the butter. Season to taste."
- "Slice the steak on the bias and drizzle the sauce over top. This is YUMMY with creamed spinach and hash browns or baked potato and a nice big salad."
