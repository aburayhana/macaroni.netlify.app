recipeingredient:
- "20 or so fresh shrimp"
- "1 leek mediumsized chopped"
- "1 rib celery mediumsized chopped"
- "1 carrot small chopped"
- "1/2 bell pepper chopped"
- "1 tsp tomato paste"
- "1 cup chicken stock"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "2 1/2 tbs olive oil"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1/4 tsp celery seeds"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- "2 tbs flour"
- "2 tbs butter"
- "1/4 fresh lemon"
- "1/2 tsp dried parsley"
- "1 cup grape tomatoes cut into thirds optional"
- "2 tsp capers optional"
- " To taste salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dice up the leek, celery, carrot, and bell pepper (I&#39;m going to call this the mirepoix, even though it technically isn&#39;t)"
- "Peel the shrimp, reserving the heads, tails, and shells for the sauce."
- "In a large saucepan, heat 1 tbs of oil over medium heat and saut√© the mirepoix (with the bay leaf) until tender."
- "Add in the tomato paste and and stir until combined."
- "Add the reserved heads, tails, and peels to the mirepoix, mix to coat with oil, and press down on them a few times with a spatula to get out all that good shrimp flavor. Saut√© for another five minutes or so until the shrimp parts turn red, stirring and pressing occasionally."
- "Add the chicken stock, bring the heat up to a boil, then reduce and let simmer until stock is reduced by 1/2 or so."
- "In the meantime, make a brown roux with the butter and flour. I did this by melting the butter, adding in the flour and stirring continuously over medium heat for about six minutes or so until it turned caramel colored and gave off a nutty smell. Set roux aside."
- "When sauce is reduced, pour the contents of the sauce pan into a strainer over a small saucepan until all you have is the liquid broth."
- "Add the celery seeds, paprika, and black pepper to the broth. Bring up the heat and incorporate the roux. Reduce until sauce coats the back of a spoon -- runny but not watery. NOTE: I would use between 1 and 1 1/2 tbs of the roux -- I put 2 tbs in the recipe to err on the side of caution. Taste the sauce and season as necessary; I didn&#39;t add any salt because the chicken stock had enough already."
- "In a separate pan, heat 1 tbs oil over medium and cook the shrimp with the lemon juice, the dried parsley, and the pepper. I cook the shrimp in batches to avoid crowding. Season to taste."
- "For the tomatoes, cook them over medium heat with 1/2 tbs of oil until tender or you can cook them in batches with the shrimp. Season to taste."
- "Add shrimp to plate, pour on the sauce, top with tomatoes and capers, and serve."
