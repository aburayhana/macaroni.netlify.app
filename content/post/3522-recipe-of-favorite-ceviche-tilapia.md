- "Chop up finely the red onion, jalapeno, bell pepper, and place in bowl. *Avocado can be added. Drizzle lightly with lemon juice to preserve color. Salt &amp; pepper lightly."

- "Remove the tilapia from the refrigerator and drain off the juice. Add the orange juice, wait a few minutes, then gently squeeze the fish with your hand to remove all excess juice. Add the fish to the bowl and lightly mix. Cover and chill for 15 minutes."
- "To serve, place bowl on a platter and put corn tortilla chips around the side of the bowl. Note: I use purple chips for added contrasting color."
