- "80 grams pine nuts"
- "1 clove of garlic"
- "2 dry red chillies"

- "1 Freshly grated Parmesan cheese optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put 6 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan. Add the garlic cut into slices and the red chillies and cook over low heat until the garlic is lightly brown. If you want it to taste more like garlic or more spicy, add both ingredients finely chopped. Set aside."
- "While the garlic and chilli are cooking, toast the pine nuts in a pan over low heat without oil. Do it carefully because they burn easily. Set aside."
- "Cook the pasta following the steps of the package. Before it is ready, reserve 4 tablespoons of the cooking water, then drain the pasta."
- "Put back the pasta to the pan. Add the drained sardines, pine nuts, parsley and the reserved cooking water. Remove the garlic and chilli oil from the oil (this step is not necessary if they were chopped finely) and add to the pasta quickly."
- "Stir while it&#39;s still on the fire with a wooden spoon so the sardines melt a bit and the pasta gets a smooth feel. Season, add a little oil if necessary and serve immediately, if you want with Parmesan cheese."
