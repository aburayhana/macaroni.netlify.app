recipeinstructions:

- "Knead the dough well and form a ball. Leave the dough to rest for a while (If the dough is stiff, add a little water to adjust.)"
- "Roll the rested dough about 3 to 5 mm thick (no. 3 on the thickness dial on a pasta machine)."

- "Roll the folded dough again to 3-5 mm thickness."
- "Fold the dough again, tucking in the ragged edges."

- "Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and simmer."
- "Boil the pasta for 1 to 3 minutes in plenty of boiling water. Add a little olive oil to the cooking water to prevent the pasta from sticking. Since puttanesca sauce is salty because of the anchovies, you don&#39;t need to salt the cooking water unlike with other pasta dishes."
- "Serve the sauce on the pasta."
- "If you want to fully enjoy the flavor of the black squid ink pasta on its own: Boil in salted water. Omit step 15 of the sauce making process. Sauté the pasta in the spicy garlic oil from step 14 with a little bit of the cooking water, and make a simple aglio, olio e peperoncino."
