Hey everyone, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, carbonara of the sea!!!. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

For creamy sea urchin pasta recipes, the typical process is to sauté garlic, shallots, and chilies in olive oil, then add the pasta and pour in a sauce made from raw sea urchin roe blended with softened butter or heavy cream. It&#39;s then cooked just long enough for the sauce to heat through and thicken, taking on a rich, glossy sheen. Chef Giulio Terrinoni &#39;s famous seafood carbonara is the perfect way to rekindle your love for the great Roman classic of carbonara. No mussels, calamari, or other fish.
