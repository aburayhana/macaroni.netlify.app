Roll fish tales into the spices. Fry the monkfish in the hot pan with olive oil. Monkfish is a firm and meaty fish and a great favourite of mine because it can hold an abundance of spice and pairs well with stronger flavours, sauces and marinades. I have created this simple recipe using the gorgeous fillets from the Fishmongers Choice range and made a hearty, warming and comforting stew perfect for this time of year. Place the garlic, chilli, spring onions, thyme, sugar, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper into a small blender and blend to a wet paste.
