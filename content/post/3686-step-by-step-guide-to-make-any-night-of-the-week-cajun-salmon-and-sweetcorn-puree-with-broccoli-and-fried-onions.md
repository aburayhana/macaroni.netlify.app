recipeingredient:
- "2 salmon fillets"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika and cayenne pepper"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 can or 1 cup of frozen sweetcorn"
- "1/2 lime zest and juice"
- "30 g butter"
- "Bunch coriander or mint chopped"
- " enough broccoli for two"
- "1 small onion halved and finely sliced into half moons"
- "1 tbsp flour"
- " light olive oil or a tbsp goose fat for frying"
- " salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the salmon in a grill pan and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle over the paprika and cayenne and leave to marinate while you prepare the puree and broccoli."
- "Mix the flour with the sliced onion and add salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil or goose fat in a large frying pan, add the onions and fry until crisp and crunchy. Tip into a bowl and set aside (out of reach)."
- "Add the broccoli to the frying pan and saute gently with the lid on until just tender and slightly browned. Turn the heat off but leave in the pan. Preheat the grill to high."
- "Meanwhile cook the sweetcorn in water for 3-4 minutes until tender and then drain well. Return to the pan and melt in the butter, add the lime zest, lime juice, chopped coriander or mint and salt and pepper. Place the salmon under the hot grill and cook for about 5-8 minutes until cooked through and charred on top."
- "Blitz the sweetcorn mixture with a stick blender until smooth, then return to the pan to reheat. I then cooked a little more sweetcorn and added it, whole, to add some texture, but I wouldn&#39;t do that again as it reduced the flavour intensity (just explaining why you can see the kernels in the finished photo)."
- "When the salmon is cooked reheat the broccoli if necessary and mix in the onions. Serve the salmon on top of the puree, with the broccoli and lime wedges."
