The pie came out tasting almost exactly like the ones we used to make! I added a pinch more salt and a little allspice to the recipe, also a teaspoon of poultry seasoning along with the sage that this recipe called for. I have saved this recipe and will continue the old tradition of meat pies for Thanksgiving and New Years Eve. Natchitoches (pronounced Nack-uh-dish) Meat Pies, stuffed with meaty filling and surrounded by a flaky pastry crust, are a Louisiana specialty, hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Natchitoches.

Natchitoches (pronounced Nack-uh-dish) Meat Pies, stuffed with meaty filling and surrounded by a flaky pastry crust, are a Louisiana specialty, hailing from the Central Louisiana town of Natchitoches. They&#39;re similar to an empanada with slightly different seasonings and close to a tourtiere, too. The aroma was familiar to me, and I asked for a taste. To my amazement, it was the same pie my grandmother used to serve when I was a youngster!
