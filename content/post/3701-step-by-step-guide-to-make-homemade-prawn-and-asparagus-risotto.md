recipeingredient:
- "200 g7oz raw tiger prawnsshrimp in their shells"
- "5 cm2in piece of celery"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "50 g2oz14 cup butter"
- "1 small onion or two echalion banana shallots peeled and finely sliced"
- "1 bunch thin asparagus washed"
- "500 ml17fl ozgenerous 2 cups goodquality fish stock"
- "150 g5oz23 cup arborio rice"
- "1 small glass white wine"
- "1/2 red chilli seeded and finely chopped"
- " zest and juice  lemon"
- "handful grated Parmesan cheese plus extra to serve"
- " few sprigs of fresh dill optional and lemon wedges to serve"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the prawns/shrimp in a pan, just cover with water, then cook on a medium heat for 4–5 minutes, until they turn pink. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and, when cool enough to handle, peel. Retain the stock."
- "Set aside the peeled prawns/shrimp, and return the shells to the pan containing the water. Add the celery, if you have it, and a bay leaf, then boil the liquid until it has reduced to about 100ml/31/2fl oz/scant ½ cup."
- "Meanwhile, prepare all the other ingredients – once you start cooking the risotto you can’t wander off. In a large pan, gently sauté the sliced onion (or shallot) in half the butter for about 15 minutes, until translucent and soft. Make sure they don’t brown at all."
- "To prepare the asparagus, bend the stalks to remove the woody bottom part – it should break at the right point. Cut off the heads, then slice the stalks into rounds. Fry the asparagus heads in 5ml/1 tsp of the remaining butter for 1 minute, until just tender."
- "Scoop out the prawn/shrimp shells, celery and bay leaf from the reduced liquid, then add the fish stock. Heat to simmering point, then reduce the heat to low."
- "Add the rice to the pan containing the onions and cook, stirring, until the rice is shiny. Pour in the wine and simmer, still stirring, until it has totally evaporated."
- "Start to add the hot stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring continuously. When each ladleful is absorbed, add the next. This will take about 20–30 minutes in total, until the rice is cooked al dente. Halfway through this process, add the sliced asparagus stalks."
- "When the rice is cooked, the risotto should still be slightly soupy – test by drawing draw the spoon through it and looking for a wake that holds for a few seconds."
- "When you are there, add the prawns/shrimp, chilli, lemon juice and zest, the remaining butter and a handful of Parmesan. Stir through, on the heat, adding another half-ladle of stock if needed to keep the creamy texture."
- "Let the risotto stand for a few minutes, then ladle on to warmed plates, top with the asparagus heads, a scattering of fresh dill, and a little more Parmesan. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over."
