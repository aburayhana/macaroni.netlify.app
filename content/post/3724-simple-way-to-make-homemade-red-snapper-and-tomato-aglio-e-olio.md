For anyone a little rusty on their Italian, &#34;aglio e olio&#34; translates to &#34;garlic and oil,&#34; which, along with pasta, are all you really need to make the traditional version of this dish. However, a common addition is crushed red pepper flakes for a little spice. No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it&#39;s too light, you don&#39;t get the full flavor and if it&#39;s too dark it gets bitter.
