Some like to sprinkle a fish pie with grated cheese but that&#39;s optional, as is the addition of hard-cooked eggs seen in some recipes. Serve fish pie with peas or other fresh greens.

It can be thick, thin, swirled, piped, or flattened, but it&#39;s always lightly crisped in the hot oven, and utterly delicious.
