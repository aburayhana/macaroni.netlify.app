Mound with the tuna flakes, and top with generous sprinkle of the olive salsa. To finish, sprinkle with a little of the tuna oil, and top with the arugula. Along with creamy, cooked white beans and rich, flaky oil-packed ventresca (tuna belly), this salad features bright and crisp sliced red onions, which are first soaked in ice water for a few minutes to temper their pungent bite and then quickly marinated with vinegar and salt to give them a quick-pickle pop of acidity. Put the onion, parsley, thyme, lemon zest, lemon juice, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper in a large bowl and add the cannellini beans. With the back of a fork gently crush the beans, then add the tuna and remaining oil and toss gently to combine.
