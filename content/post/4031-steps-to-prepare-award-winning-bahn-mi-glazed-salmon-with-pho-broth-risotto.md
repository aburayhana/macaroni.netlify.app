The quality of your stock is so important here, the whole dish will take on the flavor of this broth/stock, so the best flavored broth/stock will give you the best flavoured risotto. Inspired by a risotto from London restaurant Ooze, smoked salmon may sound expensive for a midweek meal, but is no more costly than cooking with red meat. I&#39;ve finally been introduced to risotto, and am obsessed with it. and I had some smoked salmon that needed to be used up. Traditional risotto takes time and effort to develop tender, velvety rice.
