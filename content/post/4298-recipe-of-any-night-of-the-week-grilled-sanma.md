- "to taste soy sauce"
- "1-2 tsp oil for your grill"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up your grill. I use my Japanese fish grill, enameled cast iron grill with a gas stove and heat it to a medium to medium-high heat. You should also be able to use a regular grill outside ( or a regular fry pan though the fry pan won&#39;t give you that special &#34;grilled&#34; flavor)."
- "Rinse the sanma and pat dry. Cut in half if your grill is too small to fit the whole fish."
- "Sanma tastes great topped with grated daikon radish so if you have it, grate some into a bowl and set aside."
- "Once your grill or pan is heated up, wipe on a bit of oil with a paper towel. Start grilling your fish!"
- "Grill each side for about 4-5 minutes, until you have some nice grill marks or the skin is a bit crispy. It might stick to the pan a little if it hasn&#39;t been seasoned yet."
- "Serve on a plate with grated daikon! You&#39;ll have to remove the bones as you eat. If the innards haven&#39;t been removed, you can technically eat those too but it&#39;s quite bitter."
- "Squeeze a slice of sudachi or lemon over the top, and top with daikon and a touch of soy sauce (or just soy sauce)"
