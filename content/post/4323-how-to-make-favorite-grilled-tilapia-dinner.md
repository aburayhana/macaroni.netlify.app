recipeinstructions:
- "I used my Forman grill to grill the tilapia, if you don&#39;t have one use another type grill. This gives it the best flavor. It can be baked or pan seared as well. At any rate, prepare your method of cooking the fillet by heating it. If you&#39;re using a grill with a fire source be careful! Remember you&#39;ve coated the fillet with oil. Non stick surfaces you may or may not want to use pan coat to ensure your fillet stays beautifully intact :-)"
- "In a saute pan add about 2TBS olive oil and heat on medium. When the pan is hot enough that a piece of vegetable will sizzle but not fry, add all vegetables (Normandy mix, onions, and mushrooms) allow to cook for about 10-15 minutes, stir occasionally. It will take about 20 minutes to cook completely if cooking from frozen."
- "After the vegetables have been cooking for about 15 minutes see that the grill is hot and add fish. Depending on thickness of fillet will depend on how long you cook it. It flakes easily when done. If you insert a fork into the thickest part and it&#39;s no longer &#39;pink&#39;, it&#39;s done. Be sure to check on it often while preparing the next step."
- "While these other items are cooking lay spinach leaves on your plate. Followed by the cucumber slices then tomato and then pepper. Add a little drizzle of dressing if you like."
- "By this time all should be done. :-) enjoy!"
