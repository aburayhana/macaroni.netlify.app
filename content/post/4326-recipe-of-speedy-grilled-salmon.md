recipeingredient:
- " marinade"
- "1 tbsp paprika"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/4 tsp white pepper"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 pinch oregano"
- "1 pinch thyme"
- "4 tbsp olive oil extra virgin"
- " fish"
- "2 8 oz Salmon fillet"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the fish before applying the rub. Prepare the grill so that it reaches a temperature of 400°F."
- "Mix all dry spices together in a bowl. Once mixed, drizzle over fish and massage in with your hands. There is no real need to apply the rub to the underside where the skin is, so drizzle the rub only on the non-skin side and rub on top and the sides of the fish."
- "After all of the rub has been applied, add the olive oil. Make sure you split up the olive oil between the top of the fish and underneath where the skin is. This is to prevent the skin from sticking to the grill."
- "Once the grill is ready, throw the fish skin-side down on the grill for about 10 minutes. If you have a thicker piece of fish, after the 10 minutes, turn the heat down to about half to avoid overcooking any thinner pieces of the fish for about 2-3 more minutes. During the grilling, the flames may breach the grate and char the sides of the fish. This is OK."
- "Serve the fish fresh off the grill. The fish should flake easily if it is done."
