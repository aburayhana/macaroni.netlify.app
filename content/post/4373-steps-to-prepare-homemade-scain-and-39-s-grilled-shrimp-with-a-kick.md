I have never been disappointed with a Skinnytaste recipe, but this shrimp is dreamy and exceeds expectations. Shrimp, unlike chicken or steak, can take on the flavors of a bright, acidic marinade in minutes, making it a good choice for last-minute grilling. You actually don&#39;t want to let shrimp sit in the marinade for too long because the acid in the citrus will start to firm up. When grilled with an herby, garlicky chimichurri sauce that doubles as both the marinade and a dipping sauce, these shrimp skewers only take five If you&#39;re looking for something other than chicken and burgers to grill, shrimp is the answer.
