I used a white firm fleshed fish in this and it didn&#39;t have much bone at all, so this curry was really good. I&#39;ll always believe my spicy mango sauce tastes better because I cut it by hand. I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed it as a dip with some tortilla chips, but I do think this would go really well with chicken. I just love that sweet/spicy combo, and the longer it sat the better it tasted, IMO.
