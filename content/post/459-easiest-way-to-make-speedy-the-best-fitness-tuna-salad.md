recipeinstructions:
- "First, you need to break up the tuna with a fork. Toss with the mixed salad."
- "Cut your tomato, red onion, olives, cucumber into small pieces and add them to the tuna-salad mix."
- "Here go the chickpeas and then mix all the things together in your bowl."
- "When you are done, you can make your topping and seasoning. For the topping you just squeeze the lemon, to taste, if using.  Chef’s note: “I like to mix the lemon juice and a little bit of the fish oil left in the can, it makes our salad smoother and adds great moisture to dissolve the spices.

- "Sprinkle the top with a little Parmesan. The aroma of the cheese makes the flavors even better."
- "Enjoy!"
