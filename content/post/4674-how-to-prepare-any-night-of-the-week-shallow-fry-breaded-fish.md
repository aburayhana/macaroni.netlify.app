recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare 300 g of white fish. (150g/pax). I defrosted frozen dory fillets. They were easy to handle and were of appropriate size to bread."

- "Prepare 3 shallow bowls:  1st bowl: 1/4 cup flour, salt and pepper and seasonings, incorporated well.   2nd bowl:  Breadcrumbs  3rd bowl: 2 eggs, whisked thoroughly"
- "Now, have a systematic breading system on your kitchen counter top.  Fish-&gt; flour -&gt; eggs -&gt; breadcrumbs-&gt; dry platter  Heat up the oil to medium high, or until a breadcrumb dropped in sizzles just a little. Take the piece of fish, dip in this order: 1) flour, pat of excess 2) egg 3) flour again, pat off excess 4) egg 5) breadcrumbs  Repeat this one by one and place on the platter."
- "Once all the fish have been breaded, the oil should have been hot enough. Test the heat with a few breadcrumbs. It should sizzle nicely. Fry off the fish in batches. Shallow-frying means that the oil does not completely cover the fish, so you would have to flip the fish. Fry each side for approximately 3 minutes."
- "Serve the fish with a sauce, and a side if the fish is a main, or a main dish, if the fish is a side."
