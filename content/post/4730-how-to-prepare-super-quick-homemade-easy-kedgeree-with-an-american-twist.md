- "While waiting for the water to boil, put the mustard seed in the second pan for about a minute, then reduce the heat to medium, occasionally stirring until the seeds begin to pop and brown. Be careful to not burn them."
- "Dump the rest of the curry base on top of the mustard seed and mix together."
- "Now add in the fresh spices into your home made curry mix and continue to mix them in the pan. The water should be starting to boil by now, so reduce it to medium-low heat."

- "In a small bowl mix about a cup and a half of the fat free Greek yogurt with 2 or 3 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce (to taste). Place on side for now."
- "Once the rice is hot, and the fish is cooked, place the fish on top of the rice and break apart mixing both of them together. Serve in bowls with a hearty dollop of the sweet chili yogurt dressing to cool off the spiciness of the curry."
- "If you&#39;re not a fan of fish, feel free to remove it from the recipe or replace it with Tofu, baked brussel sprouts, or chicken."
