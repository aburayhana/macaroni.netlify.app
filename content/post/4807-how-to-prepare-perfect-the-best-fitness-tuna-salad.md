- "1 piece red onion"
- "1 cup olives"
- "1 cup chickpeas"
- "1/2 of a Cucumber"
- "2 tbsp Parmesan"
- " salt and pepper"
- " freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice"
- "1 tsp Dijon mustard"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, you need to break up the tuna with a fork. Toss with the mixed salad."
- "Cut your tomato, red onion, olives, cucumber into small pieces and add them to the tuna-salad mix."
- "Here go the chickpeas and then mix all the things together in your bowl."
- "When you are done, you can make your topping and seasoning. For the topping you just squeeze the lemon, to taste, if using.  Chef’s note: “I like to mix the lemon juice and a little bit of the fish oil left in the can, it makes our salad smoother and adds great moisture to dissolve the spices. You can use avocado if you want, instead of more tomato”"
- "Add the Dijon mustard and mix. Be careful, do not mix them overmuch because you smash the leaves of the lettuce. Your goal is a homogeneous taste but not a paste."
- "Sprinkle the top with a little Parmesan. The aroma of the cheese makes the flavors even better."
- "Enjoy!"
