I prefer to leave it on the hob for at least an hour. 2 hours is even better. Just remember to keep an eye on the pot as you may need to add a splash of water if it becomes too dry."
- "Season the bolognese to taste."
- "Cook your spaghetti, drain, leave a little water in the pot to stop it from sticking. A splash of olive oil will also help with this and gives the pasta a nice shine."

- "Serve with garlic bread and grated Parmesan cheese."
