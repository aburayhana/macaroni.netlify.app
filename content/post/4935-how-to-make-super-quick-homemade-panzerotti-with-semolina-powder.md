recipeinstructions:
- "Dissolve the dry yeast in 1 tablespoon lukewarm water. Add all the ingredients for the dough little by little and knead. Form the dough to the consistency of a baby&#39;s cheek."
- "Cover it with plastic wrap, and let it sit for 1 hour in a sunny place until it expands. Knead the dough and then cover it again, making it airtight and set it in the fridge to rise a second time."
- "Finely chop the tomato, and then cook it with olive oil over low-medium heat. Simmer it until it cooks down to about half into a purée."
- "The important point is not to overpower the flavor of the fillings, and not to use strong tasting cheese; therefore there&#39;s no need to add basil or garlic to the tomato."
- "Dice the mozzarella cheese into 1 cm cubes and finely mince the olives."
- "Take the dough out and roll it into a 3 cm diameter log, and divide it into 2 cm pieces. Place the cut side on a plastic cutting board, then flatten them into a circle to make the dough for the dumplings."

- "Fry them in oil over medium heat until golden brown. They are best enjoyed piping hot! It&#39;ll make you feel like you just took a trip to Milan. The cheese and tomato purée should burst from then center when you cut into it."
- "The authentic version doesn&#39;t use any semolina powder--only bread flour. The only fillings available are ham, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese."
- "This recipe has been handed down for three generations in Luini, which is in the tip of the boot shape of Italy. They aren&#39;t traditionally eaten in Southern Italy, so it was introduced by immigrants."
- "It seems like a lot of famous architects, designers, and politicians are from the south of Italy, and are known for being aggressive."
- "This is a different version of these dumplings that uses mashed potatoes as the main ingredient. You can make them as you like, or as they do in Luini."
- "At first, it was just people in southern Italy who ate this, but now, even foreign tourists line up to buy them. One costs about 250 yen."
