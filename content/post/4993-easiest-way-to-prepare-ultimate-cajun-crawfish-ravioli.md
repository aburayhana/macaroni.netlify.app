recipeinstructions:
- "Make the dough. Mound the flour on a large cutting board and make a wide well in the middle. Add the eggs and olive oil and season with salt. Beat the eggs with a fork, then use the fork to break the wall of the well and incorporate the flour into the eggs. Gather the dough into a ball; don&#39;t worry if there are lumps."
- "Knead the dough. Using the heels of your hands, push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself and push again (put your whole body into it!). Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and supple, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at least 1 hour at room temperature."
- "Mix all filling ingredients in a bowl using a hand blender or food processor.  Cover bowl and refrigerate until we need it later."
- "Make the sauce. Drizzle olive oil into a large deep pan.  Saute garlic .  Add bell peppers, onions and cook down.  Add the seasonings and powders and set aside once veggies are soft.  You’ll add the shrimp, crawfish , cream and chives when raviolis are ready to be served."
- "Roll out the dough. Cut the dough into four pieces. Flatten one piece slightly, then run it through the widest setting on a pasta roller twice, dusting with flour in between if it feels sticky. Fold the length of dough into thirds and run it through the roller two to three more times. Continue running the dough through the roller, reducing the width setting between each run, until you reach the second-to-last setting and the dough is about 1/16 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.  Assemble the ravioli. Place the lengths of dough on a floured surface. Lightly brush the lower half of each strip (the part closest to you) with water. Spoon filling onto pasta and fold the dough over the filling to meet the bottom edge. Press around each ball of filling with your index fingers, making sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out the ravioli using a 2-to-3-inch round fluted cutter. Transfer to a baking sheet dusted with semolina."
- "Cook the ravioli. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil; add the ravioli and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer with a skimmer or slotted spoon to resting plate."
- "Bring the sauce to a boil and add shrimp and crawfish and cream.  Cook 4-6 minutes until shrimp is cooked and sauce has thickened."
- "Assemble raviolis on a large pasta plate and pour sauce over pasta.  Garnish with cheese and chives"
