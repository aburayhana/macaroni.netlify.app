- "50 ml Extra virgin olive oil"
- "2 clove Garlic coarsely chopped"
- "1 Red chili peppers sliced into rounds"
- "1 Italian parsley or chervil parsleycoarsely chopped"
- "50 ml White wine sake is OK  avoid cooking sake"
- "10 grams Salted butter"
- "1 Black pepper peppercorn or crushed"
- "1 Salt"
- "1 Pepper"
- "30 ml WaterA"
- "30 ml Cooking liquid from boiling pastaA"
- "1 japanese teaspoon  All purpose flourA"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the clams by &#34;de-gritting &amp; de-salting&#34; and rinse the shells well to remove any slime or dirt. Do the de-salting especially well if you dig the clams from the ocean."
- "Refer to my journal on the 05/30/13 for how to prepare the clams. Please do &#34;de-gritting &amp; de-salting&#34; well, or it will change the taste."
- "Coarsely chop the garlic, Italian parsley, and red chili pepper as I noted above."
- "In a large pot, bring 3 liters of water to a boil for the pasta. Once it is close to boiling, add 2 tablespoon of salt (makes 1% salted water)."
- "The amount of the salt put in at Step 4 determines the taste of the pasta. Please be precise. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce heat to very low heat and have it standing by."
- "In a cold skillet, add the olive oil, garlic and the chopped red chili pepper from Step 3 and sauté them over low heat until the garlic is fragrant."
- "Once the garlic from Step 6 starts to brown and fragrant, turn up the heat to medium-high.  Add the clams from Step 1 and sauté it for about 10 seconds."
- "In the skillet from Step 7, add the white wine and Italian parsley from Step 3. Cover the skillet and braise the ingredients over medium-low heat."
- "Meanwhile, put the pasta into the Step 5 water and boil it until 30 seconds to 1 minutes shorter than the suggested cooking time, so that the pasta is still a little hard. Cook it over low heat."
- "If you boil it too long, the cooking water will get too salty, hence, the pasta will be too salty."
- "[Please be careful] Leave the heat on low, before and after you put the pasta in the water. Do not let the water come to a rapid boil."
- "Combine the ingredients A before the clams from Step 8 are done cooking. Use a measuring spoon to scoop up the pasta cooking water from Step 9."
- "When the clams from Step 8 open up about 80-90%, remove the lid. If the clams are 100% open, they will be overcooked by the time all the steps are done."
- "Right before the pasta is done cooking, add the ingredients A from Step 12 into the clams from Step 13 and turn up the heat to medium.  Toss the ingredients in the air for about 15 seconds by jiggling the skillet."
- "[Key point]  Remove the skillet in Step 14 from heat immediately after the liquid starts to thicken or emulsifies."
- "For an oil pasta, it is very important to emulsify the sauce.  Because you will cook a small amount of pasta in a pot at home, the cooking liquid is a lot thinner than that of a restaurant."
- "By adding some flour, the sauce emulsifies more easily.  Very small changes, but it is very important and the pasta will cook up like at the restaurant."
- "I normally use &#34;the cooking water + flour&#34;, but to adjust the saltiness, use &#34;the cooking liquid + water + flour&#34;."
- "The ratio of the water and the cooking liquid varies according to the saltiness of the clams.   Be careful not to simmer it too long or the water will be too salty."
- "Once the pasta is cooked, turn the heat on the skillet from Step 14.  Drain the pasta and add it in the sauce, toss them together over a little higher than low heat."
- "I would eat it as is, but if you think it is weak tasting, sprinkle a small amount of rock salt (not listed) on top."
- "Serve it on a plate and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper and enjoy."
- "Since the flavor is simple, the taste of the clams is amazing."
- "The emulsified and thickened soup has plenty of clam flavor. It is so delicious!!"
- "It is very easy and simple to make.  Just follow the procedure like the strength of the heat very carefully, and you should have the ultimate pasta just like a restaurant. Enjoy the wonderful Italian food at home."
- "I have uploaded the &#34;Authentic Vongole Rosso&#34; recipe as well.  Clam really goes well with tomato sauce."
- "This is another recipe that I previously uploaded, &#34;Vongole Bianco Soup Pasta Style&#34;.  It&#39;s another kind of vongole that has a lot of soupy sauce."
- "Is &#34;Clam Tomato Risotto&#34;. This is also an easy recipe with authentic taste. Please give it a try...  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/153125-authentic-vongole-risotto"
- "Is vongole bianco style simple pasta with oysters. I recommend this recipe for an oil pasta and/or bianco lovers.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/154079-vongole-bianco-with-oysters-and-olive-oil"
