- "season the under side of the salmon with black pepper to taste. (I find that a little bit goes a long way)"
- "flip the filet over a thinly coat it with olive oil. (I have also used egg whites in the past)"
- "coat the filet with the bread crumb mixture, making sure to coat evenly, add lightly press it into the salmon."
- "In a medium sized skillet heat enough oil to coat the pan on medium"

- "Disclaimer: don&#39;t completely trust my measurements.  I don&#39;t measure when I make this recipe I just add until it looks and tastes right.  I tried to be as close to what I think I use though. Also feel free to change up the spices, just go easy on adding salt because the Parmesan already has plenty of salt in it"
- "Tips: Use wild caught salmon, farm raised just doesn&#39;t have the same flavor.  I always grate my own Parmesan for this. The cheese holds to the salmon a lot better."
