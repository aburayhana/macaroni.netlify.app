When buying the fish, the important thing to keep in mind is the Sole fillets are often very thin, so substitute with another thicker white fish instead if you prefer more substantial fillets. This fish is accompanied with crispy smashed potatoes, made super fast by cooking them in the microwave, smashing them (this is such a satisfying step!) then pan frying them with the fish to make it fabulously crispy. Then I braise the beans while deglazing the pan - another shortcut tip! Crunchy Topped Fish with Potato Sticks.
