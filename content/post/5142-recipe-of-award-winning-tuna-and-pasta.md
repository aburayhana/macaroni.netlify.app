Tuna gets jazzed up with jalepenos and a tangy lemon mayonnaise in this fun summer pasta salad. Serve over a bed of fresh iceburg lettuce. Use more or less jalapenos to suit your taste. Here, the tuna pasta is tossed with peas, crispy bell peppers, and some bold Mediterranean flavors, including garlic, lemon, a few kalamata olives (or capers, if you prefer).
