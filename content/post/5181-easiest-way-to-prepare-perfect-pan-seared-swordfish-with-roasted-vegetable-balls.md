The Kitchen is making a week&#39;s worth of healthy, weeknight-friendly recipes, starting with Jeff Mauro&#39;s Baked Coconut Chicken with Spicy Mango Dip and Geoffrey Zakarian&#39;s Root Vegetable Lentil Stew. This recipe was excellent for us, since most swordfish recipes I have seen are for the grill and we don&#39;t have one. Pop it in the oven at the same time as this Baked Flounder with Panko and Parmesan. &#34;We do this ALL the time. It is an excellent, easy and quick side dish for any meat.
