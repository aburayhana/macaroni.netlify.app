recipeinstructions:
- "Put the dough ingredients in a bread machine and start. Once the dough has come together in a cohesive ball, add the butter (or other fat). If this is a bother, just put all the ingredients in at once."
- "Drain the tuna and corn well. Cut the ham slices in half."
- "When the dough is done, divide into 2 portions. Form into smooth balls with the seam sides down. Cover with a moist but tightly wrung out kitchen towel. Leave to rest for 15 minutes."
- "Roll out each piece of dough using a rolling pin, rolling up and down and left to right, until each piece is about 20 x 15 cm in size. Make the (A) filling roll: Spread on the mustard to start."
- "Leave a 1-2 cm gap on the long (20 cm) side for both A and B versions. This makes the dough easier to seal up after it&#39;s rolled."
- "Add the mayonnaise, corn and sliced cheese to the mustard-spread portion. Don&#39;t add too much mayonnaise or you won&#39;t be able to seal the dough together as easily."
- "For the (B) version, roll the dough out in the same way and spread with mayonnaise. Add pepper, ham slices cut in half, and tuna."
- "Roll up the dough from the side nearest you. Pinch the seam closed with your fingers."
- "Roll lightly with both hands to form a cylinder."
- "Cut into 5 pieces with a knife, put into aluminium cups and leave to rise (2nd rising), at 35 to 40°C until doubled in volume."
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C. When the bread has finished rising, top with some onion and melting cheese."
- "Once the oven has heated up, lower the temperature to 180°C, add the formed bread from Step 11 and bake. It&#39;s done in about 15 minutes. Optionally sprinkle with parsley."
- "If you don&#39;t have skim milk powder, use 100 g of water (instead of 200 g) and add 100 g of milk, for a total of 200 g of liquid. You could also use 200 g of milk."
- "If you don&#39;t have unsalted butter, use salted butter or margarine. Note that I have used a minimal amount of fat. Add 10 g more butter for a richer dough."
- "The usual fillings for this type of bread are ham + cheese, corn, tuna etc. but use whatever you like."
