- "  Daikon radish peeled"
- "  Ground meat beefpork combination"
- "  Rice"
- "  Water"
- " to 2 teaspoons  Dashi stock granules"
- " to 3 tablespoons  Soy sauce"
- " to 8 shakes  Umami seasoning optional"
- "  Katakuriko"
- "  Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the ingredients including the katakuriko."
- "Cut the daikon radish into 1 cm dice."
- "Put the ◆ ingredients (daikon radish, ground meat, rice, water) into a pan. (Rinse the rice quickly before you add it.)"
- "Turn on the heat. When the pan comes to a boil turn the heat down to low, put a lid on and simmer for 20 minutes.  Be sure to mix it several times or the rice will get stuck to the bottom of the pan!"
- "Once the daikon radish is tender, add the ● ingredients (dashi stock granules, soy sauce, Ajinomoto seasoning), put the lid back on and simmer for an additional 15 to 20 minutes."
- "Check frequently and stir well to make sure the rice doesn&#39;t get stuck to the bottom."

- "According to my mother, the daikon radish to water to ground meat ratio should be strictly 1:1:1. So it&#39;s 100 g daikon radish: 100 ml water : 100 g ground meat - for the balance of ingredients that I think is best!"
- "I use Ajinomoto brand umami seasoning in this. If you leave it out the flavor will be very different (in terms of saltiness and depth) so please adjust the seasoning by tasting it."
