- "1 Pizza Dough Store Bought"
- "6 Large Shrimp"
- "1/2 Cup Smoked Salmon"
- "3/4 Cup Scallops"
- " Pesto"
- " Cheddar Cheese"
- " Capers"
recipeinstructions:
- "Allow your pizza dough to rise on the counter. Preheat oven to 450 F. Chop salmon into bite sized pieces. (I used smoked salmon trim. It’s a lot cheaper but you’ve got to cut out some of the connective tissue. It’s worth it). Thaw, peel and devein shrimp. Slice shrimp in half lengthwise. You should have what appears to be 12 shrimp now. With a fillet knife or sharp knife, make an attempt to slice the scallops into thirds while they’re standing up."
- "Use a silicone brush to spread the pesto over your stretched out dough. Don’t overdo the pesto because the oil will really make a mess of it. A little bit goes a long way. Top with your seafood and some capers. Finish with the cheese. Use enough to cover it. It’s not rocket surgery."
- "I highly recommend that there is parchment paper on the bottom of your pizza pan. It makes life easier and you won’t want to throw the pizza out the window like a frisbee if it sticks. Bake 12-17 minutes depending on how long it takes to brown and look lovely."
- "Cut with pizza cutter and serve. You can top with grated Parmesan if you love cheese and some crushed red pepper flakes."
