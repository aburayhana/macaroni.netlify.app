I spent so much time and energy writing my &#34; Things to Eat, Drink &amp; Do in New Orleans &#34; post that, in the end, I purposely excluded the recipe that I originally wanted to include in that. Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse cauliflower until it resembles rice. Spicy, buttery, and decidedly hands-on, this dish is a New Orleans classic. Crusty French bread―and plenty of napkins―are traditional accompaniments to New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp.
