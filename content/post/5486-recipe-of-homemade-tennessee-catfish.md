Hey everyone, it's Louise, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, tennessee catfish. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

A Tennessee angler who could not find a friend to fish with last Saturday night reeled in one of the largest blue catfish ever caught in the state. Tennessee&#39;s biggest lake is a catfish factory, producing great opportunities for catching channels, flatheads and blues. Great fishing begins right at the dam, and boating anglers go as close to the dam as they are permitted. The world-record fish was caught from Arkansas waters, but directly across the river from Memphis.

Michelle S: Catfish appetizer was good, fried pickles were all breading. Salmon was cooked well but sauce was too sweet and base was just butter and cream. Go for the plain salmon not the one with bbq. The Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency posted the story.
