- "Add the grated Gouda and butter to the grits, stirring well to melt and combine, then adjust the consistency with a little more milk or water if needed. The grits should be viscous but should still “stand up” on the plate."
- "Top trout with the oyster mushroom and pecan mixture and serve alongside a helping of Gouda grits. Enjoy!"
