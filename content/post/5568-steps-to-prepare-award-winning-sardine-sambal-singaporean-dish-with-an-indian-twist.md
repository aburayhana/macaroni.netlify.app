Sambal stingray refers to a Malaysian/Singaporean dish of barbecued stingray served with a spicy sambal paste. It&#39;s a popular hawker food in Singapore that&#39;s cooked and served in banana leaves. Stingray has a firm, meaty texture that&#39;s different from other fish. Carol Selva Rajah, a Malaysian culinary expert from Sydney, explains that because the bread is so soft, they used day-old bread for another childhood favourite, the sardine sandwich.
