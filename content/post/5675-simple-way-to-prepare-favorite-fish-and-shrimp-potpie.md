recipeingredient:
- "1/4 onion chopped"
- "1/2 carrot chopped"
- "1/2 stalk celery chopped"
- "1 garlic clove finely chopped"
- "1 ear of corn"
- "3 little red potatoes diced"
- "1/4 cup frozen peas"
- "1 tilapia fillet"
- "1/2 dozen shrimp raw peeled and deviened"
- "1 tbsp thyme"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- " salt and pepper"
- "1/4 tsp paprika"
- "1/4 tsp crushed red pepper"
- "1/4 tsp dried herbs mix"
- " White sauce"
- "2 tbsp butter"
- "2 tbsp flour"
- "1 cup milk"
- " salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop up your carrot, celery, onion, garlic, and potatoes."
- "Cook your ear of corn in boiling water with a bit of butter. Remove and let cool when cooked and reserve the water. When cool, slice corn off the cob."
- "Cook the potatoes in the same water until slightly tender, not completely cooked through. Remove and reserve the water."
- "Make your sauce. Add the butter to the sauce pan on med-low and cook until melted. Add the flour and stir continuously until a paste forms. Slowly add the milk in portions at a time making sure to whisk out any clumps. Continue to stir until smooth and milk is just about at a boil. It should be thickened up a bit by now. Salt and pepper to taste. (note: if doubling the recipe, keep the butter and flour ratio 1:1 and add about a cup and a half of milk. Add more as needed). This is a great classic white sauce that can be used in any number of ways."
- "In a saute pan, heat up olive oil and cook the onion, celery, and carrots. When onion is translucent, add in the garlic and thyme and cook another minute or so."
- "Add the tilapia fillet to the mix and cook for a couple minutes on each side. It should be at med-low heat so it&#39;s not fully or overcooked."
- "Add the shrimp to the mix and cook a couple minutes on each side until slightly pink."
- "Now add the corn, potatoes, peas, sauce, dried herbs, paprika, crushed red pepper, and salt and pepper to taste. Give everything a good mix. This fish should start flaking into chunks which is great!"
- "Partially cover and simmer together for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently making sure nothing sticks to the bottom. You may need to add some of the corn/potato broth to thin it out a bit. You want it to be thin enough so it&#39;s not sticking and is slightly bubbly, but not too thin so that it looses it&#39;s stew-like texture. If you can&#39;t resist a good biscuit on the side, go for it! So tasty it doesn&#39;t even need it though.  :)"
