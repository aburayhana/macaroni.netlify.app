recipeinstructions:
- "First thing you want to do is make sure the shrimp is BARLEY thawed before you start cooking. I usually have ice still on them when I take the tails off. Set a pan on the stove and turn up to high."
- "Put a slice of butter in the pan and let it simmer. Once melted, add the shiitake mushrooms cap first into the pan. Season with steak seasoning, throw the bacon in the pan next to them, and then let sit for 5 min while you peel the tails off the shrimp."
- "Throw another bit of butter into the pan where the steak will go. Turn the pan to low since it will be very hot right now."
- "Lay the steak down and listen to it sizzle. Add some Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s (not a lot), a dash of Teriyaki Sauce, and steak seasoning. Wait around a minute and then flip over. Turn off the stove and let everything cook off the heat for 5 minutes."
- "Enjoy!"
